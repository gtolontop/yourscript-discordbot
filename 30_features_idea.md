# Proposal: 30 Features to Make the Bot 100x Better

Here is a list of 30 features (ranging from simple additions to complex systems) that would significantly improve the bot and make it an essential tool for any server. They are categorized for better organization.

## 🛠️ Ticket & Support Enhancements
1. **Auto-Transcripts with PDF Export**: Instead of just text or HTML, allow users and staff to download a cleanly formatted PDF of the ticket transcript.
2. **AI-Powered Ticket Knowledge Base**: The AI should learn from closed tickets and automatically suggest solutions to users creating new tickets before they even reach a staff member.
3. **Ticket Priority Queue system**: Allow staff to sort and view tickets based on SLA (Service Level Agreement) deadlines and assigned priority levels.
4. **Interactive Troubleshooting Menus**: Multi-step dropdown menus for common issues before a ticket is created, potentially solving the issue without human intervention.
5. **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) Dashboard**: A web dashboard solely dedicated to tracking feedback scores, response times, and staff performance metrics.

## 🤖 Advanced AI Capabilities
6. **Voice Support Parsing**: Allow users to send voice notes in tickets, and use an AI model (like Whisper) to transcribe and summarize them for staff.
7. **Image Recognition & OCR**: If a user uploads a screenshot of an error, the AI should read the text, recognize the error, and suggest a fix automatically.
8. **Emotion-aware Responses**: The AI should detect if a user is angry or frustrated over multiple messages and automatically adjust its tone to be more empathetic, while silently pinging a manager.
9. **Multi-turn Contextual Memory**: The AI should explicitly remember user preferences across different tickets (e.g., "The user mentioned they are on Windows 11 in their last ticket").
10. **Auto-Translation for Staff**: If a user speaks Spanish and the staff speaks English, the bot should seamlessly translate the conversation back and forth in real-time within the ticket.

## 🎉 Giveaways & Engagement
11. **Requirement-based Giveaways**: Giveaways that require users to be in a voice channel, have a specific role, or have sent X messages recently to enter.
12. **Multi-Winner Tiered Giveaways**: Example: 1st place gets Nitro, 2nd place gets a specific role, 3rd place gets virtual currency.
13. **Giveaway Analytics**: Track how many users joined the server specifically during a giveaway and how many left after it ended to measure campaign success.
14. **Interactive Mini-Games**: Add games like Blackjack, Trivia, or Wordle that users can play against the bot or each other for virtual economy coins.
15. **Leveling System with Custom Role Icons**: A highly customizable leveling system where users automatically get specific Discord Role Icons as they level up.

## 💰 Economy & Monetization (Integration)
16. **Tebex / Stripe Integration**: Automatically assign roles and send personalized welcome DMs when a user purchases a package on the server's store.
17. **Virtual Item Inventory / Shop**: Users can buy custom roles, temporary permissions, or color roles using their earned virtual currency.
18. **Economy Value Fluctuation (Stock Market)**: A mini-stock market system where the value of certain virtual items fluctuates based on server activity.
19. **Subscription Management via Bot**: Allow users to check their store subscription status or cancel it directly via a bot command.
20. **Crypto Wallet Verification**: Web3 integration to verify wallet ownership for exclusive "holder" roles (NFTs/Tokens).

## 🛡️ Moderation & Security
21. **Automated Phishing & Scam Detection**: Proactively scan all messages and attachments for known scam links, instantly deleting them and quarantining the user.
22. **Raid Protection Mode**: A toggleable visual dashboard switch that automatically locks down the server, purges recent joins, and increases verification levels.
23. **Cross-Server Ban Sync**: If a known scammer is banned in another server using the bot, they are automatically flagged or banned here.
24. **Voice Channel Moderation**: Ability for the bot to record the last 30 seconds of a voice channel if someone uses a `/report_voice` command for evidence.
25. **Advanced Alt-Account Detection**: Flag accounts created within the last 24 hours or with default avatars and place them in a holding channel.

## ⚙️ Utility & Infrastructure
26. **Custom Embed Builder Interface**: A fully interactive web UI where admins can build embeds visually and have the bot post them in any channel.
27. **Scheduled Announcements System**: Plan and format announcements weeks in advance via the dashboard, complete with pings and images.
28. **Temporary Voice Channels (VoiceMaster)**: Users can create custom voice channels that delete themselves when empty, with commands to change name, limit, and bitrate.
29. **GitHub / Trello Integration**: Automatically create Trello cards or GitHub issues from Discord tickets with a simple staff command.
30. **Server Analytics Reports**: The bot DMs the owner every Sunday with a beautiful image summarizing the week's stats (new joins, most active channels, ticket volume).
